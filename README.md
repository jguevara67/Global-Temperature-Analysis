# Global Temperature Analysis

## Project Overview
This data science project analyzes the recorded global temperature dataset from UC Berkeley. The aim is to uncover trends and patterns in global temperatures over time using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Data Source
The primary dataset used in this project can be found at (https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) with a complete text file of the data at (https://berkeley-earth-temperature.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Global/Land_and_Ocean_complete.txt), which includes monthly global temperature records from 1850 to the present. Key columns in the dataset are:

- `dt` (date)
- `LandAverageTemperature`
- `LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty`
- `LandMaxTemperature`
- `LandMinTemperature`
- `LandAndOceanAverageTemperature`

## Analysis Notebooks
Two Jupyter notebooks are included for detailed analysis:

1. **SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb**
   - Focus: Linear Regression analysis on temperature trends.
   - Contains 67 cells, including 26 markdown explanations and 41 code cells.
   - Key Features: Data loading, preprocessing, linear regression modeling, and results visualization.

2. **RandomForest.ipynb**
   - Focus: Using Random Forest algorithm for more complex pattern recognition.
   - Contains 21 cells, with 9 markdown explanations and 12 code cells.
   - Key Features: Advanced modeling, feature importance analysis, and predictive accuracy assessment.

## How to Run
To run the analysis:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed with the required libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in a Jupyter environment and execute cells in sequence.
